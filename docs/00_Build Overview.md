# Build Overview | Yext Hitchhikers Platform

## What You’ll Learn

In this section, you will learn:

- What Pages is
- How the pieces of the development process fit together

## Overview

Pages is a powerful platform for developing performant and SEO-optimized websites that leverage Yext Content.

This track will teach you how to create a site with Pages using a starter repo. By the end of this track, you will build and deploy your own site (Turtlehead Tacos) for a fictional restaurant with locations in New York, NY.

The power of Pages is simple: as a developer, you can use the most up-to-date web dev technologies, while content managers can update data seamlessly through an intuitive UI.

**Note**
You do not have to use React to build your site. If you don’t want to use React at all, check out this reference on [Pure JavaScript Rendering](Pure JavaScript Rendering).

## Developing with Pages

Before diving in, here is a high-level overview of the development process and Pages architecture.

Yext Pages is built on [Yext Content](Yext Content), which is a database that lets you store structured information about your business.

Pages then integrates this data with your frontend code and transforms Content into web pages using a [Jamstack](Jamstack) architecture. Your site is then generated by Yext through an automatic integration with Github, and served via global CDN.
