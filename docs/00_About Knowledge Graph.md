Depending on your business, you may have tens or even hundreds of individual entities that make up your knowledge graph. These include specific locations, jobs, products, or individuals (like “John Smith”).

The entity types these fall into can be jobs, locations, people, services, events, FAQs, specialties, products, limited time offers, and more.

Entity types will vary across businesses, but you can determine which are important to your business based on the objectives you would like to achieve. For example, you might want to drive interest in a new product or service being offered. Or perhaps you want to showcase the jobs you have available or upcoming events. Having these facts stored in your knowledge graph as entities will allow you to:

- Increase discoverability
- Streamline the customer experience
- Drive customer engagement

Below, we have highlighted sample objectives and entities that could pertain to three different verticals (Food, Healthcare, and Financial Services):

## Sample entities across verticals

As you can see, the data behind the entities will help support the key initiative/business objective. For example, in order to increase menu discoverability, a restaurant could create entities for their menu items and for meal time periods (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.).
