  1 | # PAGES-STARTER-REACT-BASIC
  2 | 
  3 | This repository provides a basic example of how to start developing a React site on the Yext Sites system.
  4 | 
  5 | ## Quickstart Instructions
  6 | 
  7 | ### Prerequisites
  8 | 
  9 | 1. Have the Yext CLI installed: https://hitchhikers.yext.com/guides/cli-getting-started-resources/01-install-cli/
 10 | 2. Have Deno installed, version 1.21.0 or later: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation
 11 | 3. Have node installed, version 17 or later: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 12 | 
 13 |    - It's recommend to use nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating or via brew `brew install nvm`
 14 | 
 15 | 4. Optional: Have a Yext account (necessary for production builds, deploying on Yext Sites, and pulling local stream document data via `yext sites generate-test-data`). This starter already comes with some localData that can be used for local dev without the need to init with a Yext account.
 16 | 
 17 | ### Getting started
 18 | 
 19 | 1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:
 20 | 
 21 |    ```bash
 22 |    git clone https://github.com/yextconsulting/pages-starter-react-consulting.git
 23 |    cd pages-starter-react-consulting
 24 |    npm install
 25 |    ```
 26 | 
 27 | 2. If this client's Knowledge Graph account isn't already set up, follow the steps below under "Set up the Knowledge Graph Account"
 28 | 3. You’re good to go! Run `npm run dev` to spin up a local development server and take a look at your starter site.
 29 | 
 30 | ### Set up the Knowledge Graph Account
 31 | 
 32 | 1. Run `yext init` and authenticate the CLI with your Yext credentials. Add the `-u sandbox` flag if you're using a sandbox Yext account.
 33 | 2. Run `yext resources apply platform-config/config` to apply the required configuration resources to your account.
 34 | 3. Run `yext resources apply platform-config/entities` to add the necessary entities to your account. This includes a test location entity which can be deleted before running the apply command if desired.
 35 | 
 36 |    - You will be prompted to enter several API keys during this step which power the `<Reviews>`, `<Nearby>` and `<Locator>` components. If you do not plan to use these components, you can skip the API key input by pressing Enter.
 37 |    - The Reviews API key should come from a developer app with Read access to the Management API > Reviews endpoint.
 38 |    - The Nearby API key should come from a developer app with Read access to the Content Delivery API > Entities endpoint.
 39 |    - The Search API key should be an API key from the search experience in your account you plan to use for your locator. If you plan to use the search experience that is created automatically for you in step 5, you can skip this step by hitting **Enter** and fill in the key after the search experience has been created.
 40 |    - These keys will live on the Site entity that is created during this step, so you can always update or add the keys later once the entity has been created.
 41 |    - For guidance on creating a developer app in the Yext plaform, see the first two steps of the Slug Manager section below.
 42 | 
 43 | 4. Optionally, run `yext resources apply platform-config/advanced` to apply test product, financial professional and faq entities to your account as well as an updated test location which links to these newly created entities. To make sure this related entity information is displayed on your location template, navigate to **src** > **layouts** > **entity.tsx** and comment in the Product, Team and FAQ field sets in the `fields` section of the `configBuilder` function. These fields will now be included in the stream that powers your location template.
 44 | 5. If you are implementing a locator search experience, run `yext resources apply platform-config/search` to apply the locator search config to your account.
 45 | 6. In the Yext platform, run the directory manager named “Directory” that was created as part of the resource apply command in Step 3. This will create the location-related entities necessary to render a directory on the frontend based on your account’s location entities.
 46 |    1. Navigate to **Pages** > **Directory Manager**.
 47 |    2. Click to view the directory, then click **Run**.
 48 | 7. If you plan to leverage the `<Nearby>` component to show nearby locations, navigate to **src** > **components** > **entity** > `Nearby.tsx` and replace the placeholder `savedFilterIds` value in the `getConfig` function with the ID of the saved filter you use to filter which locations should be live on your site. If you do not use a saved filter, delete this line entirely.
 49 | 8. If you plan to use the `<Locator>` component, you will need to have a map provider API key and update the placeholder value in **src** > `config.ts` with your key. You will also need to ensure the `experienceKey` and `verticalKey` values match the search experience you'd like to use.
 50 | 9. If you did not provide API keys for the `<Reviews>`, `<Nearby>` and `<Locator>` components during step 4, these components will not work properly and will produce errors if used.
 51 | 10. If you are working in a sandbox Yext account, refer to the Working With a Sandbox Account section below to see what changes need to be made to the repo.
 52 | 11. See [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1sNSciY0zD4SVVhRYaoFo9yC7u3InBz/view?usp=sharing) for a detailed video walk-through of these instructions.
 53 | 
 54 | ### Working With A Sandbox Account
 55 | 
 56 | There are a few changes that must be made to the repo to ensure it works with sandbox Yext accounts:
 57 | 
 58 | 1. If you plan to leverage the `<Nearby>` component to show nearby locations, navigate to **src** > **components** > **entity** > **Nearby.tsx** and update the `endpoint` value in the `getConfig` function to `https://liveapi-sandbox.yext.com/v2/accounts/me/entities/geosearch`.
 59 | 2. If you plan to leverage the `<Locator>` search component, navigate to **src** > `config.ts` and comment in the `endpoints: SandboxEndpoints` line of the `provideHeadless` function and update your import from `@yext/search-headless-react` accordingly.
 60 | 3. Follow step 3 in the Slug Manager section to make the plugin work with your sandbox account.
 61 | 
 62 | ### Implementing the Slug Manager
 63 | 
 64 | The Slug Manager helps to automate the process of populating and updating the builtin `slug` field on your entities. The `slug` field is used to determine what the URL of each entity-powered page will be. If you’d like to use the Slug Manager, follow the instructions below:
 65 | 
 66 | 1. In the Yext platform, navigate to **Developer** > **Developer Console**. Click **Add an App**. Name it "Slug Manager" and click **Create App**.
 67 | 2. In the **API Credentials** section, add **Read / Write** permissions to the **Management API** > **Entities** endpoint and click **Save**. Copy the API Key on this page as you’ll need it in the next step.
 68 | 3. If you are working in a sandbox Yext account, navigate to `platform-config/slug-manager/plugin/mod.ts` and add `env:”sandbox”` to the object being passed to the `createSlugManager` function. For example:
 69 | 
 70 |    ```jsx
 71 |    export const { webhook, connector } = createSlugManager({
 72 |      apiKey: API_KEY,
 73 |      slugFormat: (lang, profile) => {
 74 |        if (lang === "en") {
 75 |          return "[[address.region]]/[[address.city]]/[[address.line1]]";
 76 |        }
 77 |        return "[[localeCode]]/[[address.region]]/[[address.city]]/[[address.line1]]";
 78 |      },
 79 |      fields: [],
 80 |      entityTypes: ["location"],
 81 |      env: "sandbox", // add this line for sandbox accounts
 82 |    });
 83 |    ```
 84 | 
 85 | 4. Run `yext resources apply platform-config/slug-manager` to add the slug management plugin and connector to your account. When you are prompted to provide an API key, paste the key you copied from your developer app and hit **Enter**.
 86 | 5. To populate an initial `slug` value for all your location entities, go into the Yext platform and navigate to **Content** > **Connectors**. Go to the **Update All Slugs** connector and click **Run Connector**.
 87 | 6. To ensure `slug` values are kept up to date when data changes or new entities are created, navigate back to the developer app you created and navigate to the **Webhooks** section. Click **Add a Webhook**.
 88 | 7. Select **Entities** as the Webhook Type and click **Next**.
 89 | 8. Name your webhook whatever you’d like. Under where it says “URL”, click on **…or invoke a function**.
 90 | 9. Select the **Slug-Manager** function and click the webhook option. Hit **Finish and Add**.
 91 | 10. The Slug Manager is now set up and ready to go!
 92 | 
 93 | ### Page URL Writebacks
 94 | 
 95 | It is a common practice to store an entity page URL as a field on the entity itself. Yext will automatically update a custom field with the entity page URL anytime the pages URLs are updated. You can configure the custom field Yext will write the URL to with the `pageUrlField` property within the config export of each Stream template.
 96 | 
 97 | See the Hitchhiker reference for more information: [Page URL Writebacks](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/pages/url-writebacks/).
 98 | 
 99 | ## Useful commands
100 | 
101 | `yext init` - Authenticates the Yext CLI with your Yext account
102 | 
103 | `npm run dev` - runs your code against a local dev server using Vite
104 | 
105 | - All stream documents come from the `localData` folder
106 | - You can visit either of these urls out of the box
107 |   - http://localhost:3000/index/123
108 |   - http://localhost:3000/static
109 | 
110 | `npm run dev -- dynamic` - same as above except instead of using files from `localData` it will pull the document from Yext on the fly
111 | 
112 | `yext sites generate-test-data` - pull an example set of `localData` from your account
113 | 
114 | `yext sites build` - Runs a production build against your `localData`
115 | 
116 | `yext sites serve` - Runs a local server against your production-built files
117 | 
118 | - It's recommended to `yext sites build` followed by `yext sites serve` before committing in order to test that a real production build won't have any issues. In practice, development builds (via `npm run dev`) and production builds compile and bundle assets differently. For local development, ES Modules are loaded directly by the browser, allowing fast iteration during local development and also allows for hot module replacement (HMR). Other things like CSS are also loaded directly by the browser, including linking to sourcemaps. During a production build all of the different files are compiled (via ESBuild for jsx/tsx) and minified, creating assets as small as possible so that the final html files load quickly when served to a user.
119 | 
120 | `npm run fmt` - Automatically formats all code
121 | 
122 | `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for errors and warnings
123 | 
124 | ## Repository Layout
125 | 
126 | ```
127 | root
128 | └───localData
129 | └───sites-config
130 | │   │   ci.json
131 | └───src

143 | │   └───types
144 | ```
145 | 
146 | ### localData
147 | 
148 | Contains example stream documents that are used while local developing. By default this repo contains example files that work with the provided example templates. You can generate real stream documents specific to your Yext account via `yext sites generate-test-data`.
149 | 
150 | NOTE: You normally wouldn't want to check in the localData folder as it's only used for local dev. It is gitignored by default.
151 | 
152 | ### sites-config
153 | 
154 | Contains a single `ci.json` file. This file defines how the Yext CI system will build your project. It is not used during local dev. However, it is used when running a local production build (i.e. `yext sites build`).
155 | 
156 | NOTE: A `features.json` file will automatically be generated during CI build for you based on the `config`s defined in your templates. One has been checked in to this repo so that `yext sites generate-test-data` works out of the box (assuming you've `yext init`'ed with your Yext account). If this file doesn't exist then `yext sites build` will implicitly generate a new one when it calls `npm run directbuild` (defined in `sites-config/ci.json`).
157 | 
158 | ### src
159 | 
160 | #### components
161 | 
162 | This is where all of your custom components _may_ live. This folder is not required and you can set up your own custom folder structure for your own components in any way you'd like, as long as it lives in the `src` directory.
163 | 
164 | #### layouts
165 | 
166 | This is where wrapper components _may_ live. Like `/components` this folder is not required, and only serves organizational benefits. Layouts help encapsulate top level components across templates. A top level component can be a header, footer, react context, or anything else you'd like to preserve across multiple templates.
167 | 
168 | #### templates
169 | 
170 | Required. This is where your actual templates live. There are effectively two types of components:
171 | 
172 | 1. stream-based templates: those that have an exported `config`
173 | 1. static templates: those that don't have an exported `config`. Furthermore, they may also export a `getStaticProps` function if external data is required.
174 | 
175 | NOTE: It's not currently possible to generate multiple html files using a static template, even if `getStaticProps` returns arrayed data.
176 | 
177 | #### types
178 | 
179 | Here you can define any custom TypeScript types you need.
180 | 
181 | #### index.css
182 | 
183 | Not required. In this example this sets up Tailwind CSS.
184 | 
185 | ### vite.config.js
186 | 
187 | Vite is now a first class member of the starter! This file defines any custom Vite configuration you want, giving you full control over your setup. Specifically, it will allows users to pass additional configuration options to the vite-plugin-yext-sites-ssg plugin when they become more widely available.
188 | 
189 | ### Everything else
190 | 
191 | The rest of the files are basic config setup common to many other React projects. In this example we've enabled:
192 | 
193 | 1. Tailwind CSS (which leverages PostCSS) - used for easy styling
194 | 1. ESLint - catches errors in your code
195 | 1. Prettier - formats your code (you can add .prettierrc to override any default settings)
196 | 1. TypeScript - adds typing to Javascript for a better developer experience
197 |

  521 |    1. Definitions.
  522 | 
  523 |       "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

  530 |       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
  531 |       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
  532 |       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
  533 |       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  534 |       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

  539 | 
  540 |       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

  548 | 
  549 |       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  550 |       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  551 |       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

  553 | 
  554 |       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  555 |       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  556 |       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  557 |       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  558 |       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  559 |       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  560 |       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  561 | 
  562 |       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  563 |       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  564 |       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

  569 |       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

  571 |       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  572 |       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  573 |       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

  575 | 
  576 |       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

  579 | 
  580 |    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  581 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  582 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  583 |       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  584 |       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  585 |       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  586 | 
  587 |    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  588 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  589 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  590 |       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  591 |       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  592 |       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  593 |       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  594 |       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  595 |       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  596 |       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  597 |       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  598 |       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  599 |       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  600 |       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  601 |       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  602 | 
  603 |    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  604 |       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  605 |       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  606 |       meet the following conditions:
  607 | 
  608 |       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
  609 |           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  610 | 
  611 |       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  612 |           stating that You changed the files; and
  613 | 
  614 |       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  615 |           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  616 |           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  617 |           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  618 |           the Derivative Works; and
  619 | 
  620 |       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  621 |           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  622 |           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  623 |           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  624 |           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  625 |           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  626 |           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  627 |           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  628 |           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  629 |           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  630 |           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  631 |           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  632 |           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  633 |           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  634 |           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  635 |           as modifying the License.
  636 | 
  637 |       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  638 |       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  639 |       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  640 |       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  641 |       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  642 |       the conditions stated in this License.
  643 | 
  644 |    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  645 |       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  646 |       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  647 |       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  648 |       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  649 |       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  650 |       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  651 | 
  652 |    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  653 |       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  654 |       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  655 |       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  656 | 
  657 |    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  658 |       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  659 |       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  660 |       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  661 |       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  662 |       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  663 |       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  664 |       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  665 |       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  666 | 
  667 |    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  668 |       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  669 |       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  670 |       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  671 |       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  672 |       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  673 |       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  674 |       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  675 |       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  676 |       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  677 |       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  678 | 
  679 |    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  680 |       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  681 |       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  682 |       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  683 |       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  684 |       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  685 |       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  686 |       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  687 |       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  688 |       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  689 | 
  690 |    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  691 |

  896 | # @rollup/plugin-inject
  897 | 
  898 | 🍣 A Rollup plugin which scans modules for global variables and injects `import` statements where necessary.
  899 | 
  900 | ## Requirements
  901 | 
  902 | This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.
  903 | 
  904 | ## Install
  905 | 
  906 | Using npm:
  907 | 
  908 | ```console
  909 | npm install @rollup/plugin-inject --save-dev
  910 | ```
  911 | 
  912 | ## Usage
  913 | 
  914 | Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:
  915 | 
  916 | ```js
  917 | import inject from '@rollup/plugin-inject';
  918 | 
  919 | export default {
  920 |   input: 'src/index.js',
  921 |   output: {
  922 |     dir: 'output',
  923 |     format: 'cjs'
  924 |   },
  925 |   plugins: [
  926 |     inject({
  927 |       Promise: ['es6-promise', 'Promise']
  928 |     })
  929 |   ]
  930 | };
  931 | ```
  932 | 
  933 | Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).
  934 | 
  935 | This configuration above will scan all your files for global Promise usage and plugin will add import to desired module (`import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'` in this case).
  936 | 
  937 | Examples:
  938 | 
  939 | ```js
  940 | {
  941 |   // import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'
  942 |   Promise: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],
  943 | 
  944 |   // import { Promise as P } from 'es6-promise'
  945 |   P: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],
  946 | 
  947 |   // import $ from 'jquery'
  948 |   $: 'jquery',
  949 | 
  950 |   // import * as fs from 'fs'
  951 |   fs: [ 'fs', '*' ],
  952 | 
  953 |   // use a local module instead of a third-party one
  954 |   'Object.assign': path.resolve( 'src/helpers/object-assign.js' ),
  955 | }
  956 | ```
  957 | 
  958 | Typically, `@rollup/plugin-inject` should be placed in `plugins` _before_ other plugins so that they may apply optimizations, such as dead code removal.
  959 | 
  960 | ## Options
  961 | 
  962 | In addition to the properties and values specified for injecting, users may also specify the options below.
  963 | 
  964 | ### `exclude`
  965 | 
  966 | Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
  967 | Default: `null`
  968 | 
  969 | A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.
  970 | 
  971 | ### `include`
  972 | 
  973 | Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
  974 | Default: `null`
  975 | 
  976 | A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.

 1074 |    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 1075 |    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 1076 |    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 1077 |    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 1078 |    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

 1080 | 
 1081 |    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

 1109 |    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 1110 |    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 1111 |    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 1112 |    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 1113 |    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 1114 |    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 1115 |    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 1116 |    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 1117 |    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 1118 |    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 1119 |    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 1120 |    as of the date such litigation is filed.
 1121 | 
 1122 | 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 1123 |    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 1124 |    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 1125 |    meet the following conditions:
 1126 | 
 1127 |    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 1128 |        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 1129 | 
 1130 |    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 1131 |        stating that You changed the files; and
 1132 | 
 1133 |    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 1134 |        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 1135 |        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 1136 |        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 1137 |        the Derivative Works; and
 1138 | 
 1139 |    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 1140 |        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 1141 |        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 1142 |        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 1143 |        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 1144 |        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 1145 |        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 1146 |        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 1147 |        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 1148 |        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 1149 |        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 1150 |        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 1151 |        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 1152 |        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 1153 |        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 1154 |        as modifying the License.
 1155 | 
 1156 |    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 1157 |    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 1158 |    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 1159 |    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 1160 |    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 1161 |    the conditions stated in this License.
 1162 | 
 1163 | 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 1164 |    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 1165 |    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 1166 |    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 1167 |    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 1168 |    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 1169 |    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 1170 | 
 1171 | 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 1172 |    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 1173 |    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 1174 |    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 1175 | 
 1176 | 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 1177 |    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 1178 |    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 1179 |    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 1180 |    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 1181 |    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 1182 |    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 1183 |    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 1184 |    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 1185 | 
 1186 | 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 1187 |    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 1188 |    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 1189 |    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 1190 |    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 1191 |    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 1192 |    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 1193 |    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 1194 |    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 1195 |    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 1196 |    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 1197 | 
 1198 | 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 1199 |    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 1200 |    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 1201 |    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 1202 |    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 1203 |    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 1204 |    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 1205 |    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 1206 |    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 1207 |    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 1208 | 
 1209 | END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 1269 | The following npm package may be included in this product:
 1270 | 
 1271 |  - @tailwindcss/nesting@0.0.0-insiders.565cd3e
 1272 | 
 1273 | This package contains the following license and notice below:
 1274 | 
 1275 | # @tailwindcss/nesting
 1276 | 
 1277 | This is a PostCSS plugin that wraps [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) or [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-nesting) and acts as a compatibility layer to make sure your nesting plugin of choice properly understands custom syntax like `@apply` and `@screen`.
 1278 | 
 1279 | To use it, install it via npm:
 1280 | 
 1281 | ```shell
 1282 | npm install @tailwindcss/nesting
 1283 | ```
 1284 | 
 1285 | Then add it to your PostCSS configuration, somewhere before Tailwind itself:
 1286 | 
 1287 | ```js
 1288 | // postcss.config.js
 1289 | module.exports = {
 1290 |   plugins: [
 1291 |     require('postcss-import'),
 1292 |     require('@tailwindcss/nesting'),
 1293 |     require('tailwindcss'),
 1294 |     require('autoprefixer'),
 1295 |   ]
 1296 | }
 1297 | ```
 1298 | 
 1299 | By default, it uses the [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) plugin under the hood, which uses a Sass-like syntax and is the plugin that powers nesting support in the [Tailwind CSS plugin API](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#css-in-js-syntax).
 1300 | 
 1301 | If you'd rather use [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-nesting) (which is based on the work-in-progress [CSS Nesting](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/) specification), first install the plugin alongside `@tailwindcss/nesting`:
 1302 | 
 1303 | ```shell
 1304 | npm install @tailwindcss/nesting postcss-nesting
 1305 | ```
 1306 | 
 1307 | Then pass the plugin itself as an argument to `@tailwindcss/nesting` in your PostCSS configuration:
 1308 | 
 1309 | ```js
 1310 | // postcss.config.js
 1311 | module.exports = {
 1312 |   plugins: [
 1313 |     require('postcss-import'),
 1314 |     require('@tailwindcss/nesting')(require('postcss-nesting')),
 1315 |     require('tailwindcss'),
 1316 |     require('autoprefixer'),
 1317 |   ]
 1318 | }
 1319 | ```
 1320 | 
 1321 | This can also be helpful if for whatever reason you need to use a very specific version of `postcss-nested` and want to override the version we bundle with `@tailwindcss/nesting` itself.

 2060 | 
 2061 | ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.
 2062 | 
 2063 | ## Example
 2064 | 
 2065 | Define model:
 2066 | 
 2067 | ```javascript
 2068 | var asn = require('asn1.js');
 2069 | 
 2070 | var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
 2071 |   this.seq().obj(
 2072 |     this.key('firstName').octstr(),
 2073 |     this.key('lastName').octstr(),
 2074 |     this.key('age').int(),
 2075 |     this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
 2076 |     this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
 2077 |   );
 2078 | });
 2079 | 
 2080 | var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
 2081 |   this.seq().obj(
 2082 |     this.key('time').gentime(),
 2083 |     this.key('description').octstr()
 2084 |   );
 2085 | });
 2086 | ```
 2087 | 
 2088 | Encode data:
 2089 | 
 2090 | ```javascript
 2091 | var output = Human.encode({
 2092 |   firstName: 'Thomas',
 2093 |   lastName: 'Anderson',
 2094 |   age: 28,
 2095 |   gender: 'male',
 2096 |   bio: [
 2097 |     {
 2098 |       time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
 2099 |       description: 'freedom of mind'
 2100 |     }
 2101 |   ]
 2102 | }, 'der');
 2103 | ```
 2104 | 
 2105 | Decode data:
 2106 | 
 2107 | ```javascript
 2108 | var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
 2109 | console.log(human);
 2110 | /*
 2111 | { firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
 2112 |   lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
 2113 |   age: 28,
 2114 |   gender: 'male',
 2115 |   bio:
 2116 |    [ { time: 922820400000,
 2117 |        description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
 2118 | */
 2119 | ```
 2120 | 
 2121 | ### Partial decode
 2122 | 
 2123 | Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
 2124 | you should call:
 2125 | 
 2126 | ```javascript
 2127 | var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
 2128 | console.log(human);
 2129 | /*
 2130 | { result: { ... },
 2131 |   errors: [ ... ] }
 2132 | */
 2133 | ```

 4270 |  - dlv@1.1.3
 4271 | 
 4272 | This package contains the following license and notice below:
 4273 | 
 4274 | # `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)
 4275 | 
 4276 | > Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined
 4277 | 
 4278 | 
 4279 | ### Why?
 4280 | 
 4281 | Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**
 4282 | 
 4283 | You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].
 4284 | 
 4285 | Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.
 4286 | 
 4287 | 
 4288 | ### Installation
 4289 | 
 4290 | `npm install --save dlv`
 4291 | 
 4292 | 
 4293 | ### Usage
 4294 | 
 4295 | `delve(object, keypath, [default])`
 4296 | 
 4297 | ```js
 4298 | import delve from 'dlv';
 4299 | 
 4300 | let obj = {
 4301 | 	a: {
 4302 | 		b: {
 4303 | 			c: 1,
 4304 | 			d: undefined,
 4305 | 			e: null
 4306 | 		}
 4307 | 	}
 4308 | };
 4309 | 
 4310 | //use string dot notation for keys
 4311 | delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;
 4312 | 
 4313 | //or use an array key
 4314 | delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;
 4315 | 
 4316 | delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;
 4317 | 
 4318 | //returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
 4319 | delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;
 4320 | 
 4321 | //optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
 4322 | delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';
 4323 | 
 4324 | //or if the key exists but the value is undefined
 4325 | delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';
 4326 | 
 4327 | //Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
 4328 | delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;
 4329 | 
 4330 | //undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
 4331 | delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
 4332 | delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
 4333 | delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
 4334 | ```
 4335 | 
 4336 | 
 4337 | ### Setter Counterparts
 4338 | 
 4339 | - [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
 4340 | - [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

 4402 | 
 4403 | <pre>
 4404 | Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
 4405 | 
 4406 | Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 4407 | 
 4408 | Preamble
 4409 | 
 4410 | This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.
 4411 | 
 4412 | You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.
 4413 | 
 4414 | Definitions
 4415 | 
 4416 |      "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 4417 | 
 4418 |      "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.
 4419 | 
 4420 |      "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.
 4421 | 
 4422 |      "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.
 4423 | 
 4424 |      "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 4425 | 
 4426 |      "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
 4427 | 
 4428 |      "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 4429 | 
 4430 |      "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 4431 | 
 4432 |      "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 4433 | 
 4434 |      "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.
 4435 | 
 4436 |      "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.
 4437 | 
 4438 | Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 4439 | 
 4440 | (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 4441 | 
 4442 | Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 4443 | 
 4444 | (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
 4445 | 
 4446 | (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.
 4447 | 
 4448 | Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 4449 | 
 4450 | (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 4451 | 
 4452 |      (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
 4453 |      (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
 4454 |      (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
 4455 | 
 4456 |           (i) the Original License or
 4457 |           (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
 4458 | 
 4459 | Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source
 4460 | 
 4461 | (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 4462 | 
 4463 | (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.
 4464 | 
 4465 | Aggregating or Linking the Package
 4466 | 
 4467 | (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
 4468 | 
 4469 | (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 4470 | 
 4471 | Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 4472 | 
 4473 | (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.
 4474 | 
 4475 | General Provisions
 4476 | 
 4477 | (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
 4478 | 
 4479 | (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.
 4480 | 
 4481 | (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 4482 | 
 4483 | (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
 4484 | 
 4485 | (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
 4486 | THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 4599 | Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.
 4600 | 
 4601 | NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
 4602 | for your cryptography operations.
 4603 | 
 4604 | ## Incentive
 4605 | 
 4606 | ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
 4607 | even more slower.

 4638 | ## API
 4639 | 
 4640 | ### ECDSA
 4641 | 
 4642 | ```javascript
 4643 | var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
 4644 | 
 4645 | // Create and initialize EC context
 4646 | // (better do it once and reuse it)
 4647 | var ec = new EC('secp256k1');
 4648 | 
 4649 | // Generate keys
 4650 | var key = ec.genKeyPair();
 4651 | 
 4652 | // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
 4653 | var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
 4654 | var signature = key.sign(msgHash);
 4655 | 
 4656 | // Export DER encoded signature in Array
 4657 | var derSign = signature.toDER();
 4658 | 
 4659 | // Verify signature
 4660 | console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));
 4661 | 
 4662 | // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY
 4663 | 
 4664 | var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
 4665 | var x = pubPoint.getX();
 4666 | var y = pubPoint.getY();
 4667 | 
 4668 | // Public Key MUST be either:
 4669 | // 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
 4670 | // 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
 4671 | // 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
 4672 | var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
 4673 | var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
 4674 | var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
 4675 | var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3
 4676 | 
 4677 | // Import public key
 4678 | var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');
 4679 | 
 4680 | // Signature MUST be either:
 4681 | // 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
 4682 | // 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
 4683 | // 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
 4684 | // 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)
 4685 | 
 4686 | var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
 4687 | var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
 4688 | var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3
 4689 | 
 4690 | // Verify signature
 4691 | console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
 4692 | ```
 4693 | 
 4694 | ### EdDSA
 4695 | 
 4696 | ```javascript
 4697 | var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;
 4698 | 
 4699 | // Create and initialize EdDSA context
 4700 | // (better do it once and reuse it)
 4701 | var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');
 4702 | 
 4703 | // Create key pair from secret
 4704 | var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer
 4705 | 
 4706 | // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
 4707 | var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
 4708 | var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();
 4709 | 
 4710 | // Verify signature
 4711 | console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
 4712 | 
 4713 | // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY
 4714 | 
 4715 | // Import public key
 4716 | var pub = '0a1af638...';
 4717 | var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');
 4718 | 
 4719 | // Verify signature
 4720 | var signature = '70bed1...';
 4721 | console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
 4722 | ```
 4723 | 
 4724 | ### ECDH
 4725 | 
 4726 | ```javascript
 4727 | var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
 4728 | var ec = new EC('curve25519');
 4729 | 
 4730 | // Generate keys
 4731 | var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
 4732 | var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();
 4733 | 
 4734 | var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
 4735 | var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());
 4736 | 
 4737 | console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
 4738 | console.log(shared1.toString(16));
 4739 | console.log(shared2.toString(16));
 4740 | ```
 4741 | 
 4742 | three and more members:
 4743 | ```javascript
 4744 | var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
 4745 | var ec = new EC('curve25519');
 4746 | 
 4747 | var A = ec.genKeyPair();
 4748 | var B = ec.genKeyPair();
 4749 | var C = ec.genKeyPair();
 4750 | 
 4751 | var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
 4752 | var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
 4753 | var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())
 4754 | 
 4755 | var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
 4756 | var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
 4757 | var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())
 4758 | 
 4759 | console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
 4760 | console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
 4761 | console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
 4762 | ```
 4763 | 
 4764 | NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.
 4765 | 
 4766 | ## Supported curves
 4767 | 
 4768 | Elliptic.js support following curve types:
 4769 | 
 4770 | * Short Weierstrass
 4771 | * Montgomery
 4772 | * Edwards
 4773 | * Twisted Edwards
 4774 | 
 4775 | Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:
 4776 | 
 4777 | * `secp256k1`
 4778 | * `p192`
 4779 | * `p224`
 4780 | * `p256`
 4781 | * `p384`
 4782 | * `p521`
 4783 | * `curve25519`
 4784 | * `ed25519`
 4785 | 
 4786 | NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.
 4787 | 
 4788 | ### Implementation details
 4789 | 
 4790 | ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
 4791 | the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
 4792 | or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.
 4793 | 
 4794 | All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
 4795 | provided by [hash.js][2]
 4796 | 
 4797 | ### Related projects
 4798 | 
 4799 | * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
 4800 |   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
 4801 |   node)

 5936 | The following npm package may be included in this product:
 5937 | 
 5938 |  - html-parse-stringify@3.0.1
 5939 | 
 5940 | This package contains the following license and notice below:
 5941 | 
 5942 | # html-parse-stringify
 5943 | 
 5944 | This is an _experimental lightweight approach_ to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.
 5945 | 
 5946 | As it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.
 5947 | 
 5948 | "Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!"
 5949 | 
 5950 | Why yes, yes I have :)
 5951 | 
 5952 | But the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?
 5953 | 
 5954 | Yes.
 5955 | 
 5956 | React.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a "virtual DOM" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.
 5957 | 
 5958 | As a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something's changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.
 5959 | 
 5960 | Cool idea, right?!
 5961 | 
 5962 | ## So why this?
 5963 | 
 5964 | Well, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don't like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.
 5965 | 
 5966 | If, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by _whatever_ templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you'd get the same benefit, sans React's impositions.
 5967 | 
 5968 | This may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).
 5969 | 
 5970 | But you can't just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).
 5971 | 
 5972 | This lib does exactly that.
 5973 | 
 5974 | It has two methods:
 5975 | 
 5976 | 1. parse
 5977 | 2. stringify
 5978 | 
 5979 | ## `.parse(htmlString, options)`
 5980 | 
 5981 | Takes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.
 5982 | 
 5983 | ## `.stringify(AST)`
 5984 | 
 5985 | Takes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.
 5986 | 
 5987 | ## What does the AST look like?
 5988 | 
 5989 | See comments in the following example:
 5990 | 
 5991 | ```js
 5992 | var HTML = require('html-parse-stringify')
 5993 | 
 5994 | // this html:
 5995 | var html = '<div class="oh"><p>hi</p></div>'
 5996 | 
 5997 | // becomes this AST:
 5998 | var ast = HTML.parse(html)
 5999 | 
 6000 | console.log(ast)
 6001 | /*
 6002 | {
 6003 |     // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`
 6004 |     type: 'tag',
 6005 | 
 6006 |     // name of tag if relevant
 6007 |     name: 'div',

 6043 | 
 6044 | ## the AST node types
 6045 | 
 6046 | ### 1. tag
 6047 | 
 6048 | properties:
 6049 | 
 6050 | - `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node
 6051 | - `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
 6052 | - `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
 6053 | - `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
 6054 | - `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.
 6055 | 
 6056 | ### 2. text
 6057 | 
 6058 | properties:
 6059 | 
 6060 | - `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node
 6061 | - `content` - text content of the node
 6062 | 
 6063 | ### 3. component
 6064 | 
 6065 | If you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won't keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.
 6066 | 
 6067 | This is so that it's possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another "subview" in your application that handles it's own DOM diffing.
 6068 | 
 6069 | properties:
 6070 | 
 6071 | - `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node
 6072 | - `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
 6073 | - `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
 6074 | - `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
 6075 | - `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.
 6076 | 
 6077 | ## changelog
 6078 | 
 6079 | - `3.0.1` Merged #47 which makes void elements check case insensitive. Thanks again, [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
 6080 | - `3.0.0` Merged #46 which fixed an issue with handling of whitespace. Doing major version bump since this changes behavior if you have whitespace only nodes (see merged PR and #45 for more details). Thanks [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
 6081 | - `2.1.1` Merged #41 which fixed an issue with tag nesting. Thanks [@ericponto](https://github.com/ericponto).
 6082 | - `2.1.0` Merged support for numeric tags. This allows a use case described in [this PR](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify/pull/43). Thanks [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev).
 6083 | - `2.0.3` Fixed failed publish. Accidentally published an empty package :sweat_smile:
 6084 | - `2.0.2` Fixed incorrect attribution for vulnerability disclosure. The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li. Sam Sanoop was the one who reached out to me about it.
 6085 | - `2.0.1` Addressing a reported regular expression denial of service issue found by [Yeting Li](https://github.com/yetingli) and reported to me by [Sam Sanoop](https://twitter.com/snoopysecurity) of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) THANK YOU!. The issue was that sending certain input would cause one of the regular expressions we used to lock up and not finish, freezing the process. See the test that was added for details. To be clear, this lib wasn't meant for parsing non-well formed HTML. But, better safe than sorry! So we're fixing it.
 6086 | - `2.0.0` updated to more modern dependencies/build system. Switched to prettier, etc. No big feature differences, just new build system/project structure. Added support for top level text nodes thanks to @jperl. Added support for comments thanks to @pconerly.
 6087 | - `1.0.0 - 1.0.3` no big changes, bug fixes and speed improvements.

 6929 | This license gives everyone as much permission to work with
 6930 | this software as possible, while protecting contributors
 6931 | from liability.
 6932 | 
 6933 | ## Acceptance
 6934 |

 6953 | 
 6954 | ## Excuse
 6955 | 
 6956 | If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not
 6957 | complied with [Notices](#notices), you can keep your
 6958 | license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30
 6959 | days after the notice. If you do not do so, your license
 6960 | ends immediately.
 6961 | 
 6962 | ## Patent
 6963 | 
 6964 | Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
 6965 | software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims
 6966 | they can license or become able to license.
 6967 | 
 6968 | ## Reliability
 6969 | 
 6970 | No contributor can revoke this license.
 6971 | 
 6972 | ## No Liability
 6973 | 
 6974 | **_As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,

 7737 | ## What is this?
 7738 | 
 7739 | This package exposes the default constructs.
 7740 | 
 7741 | ## When should I use this?
 7742 | 
 7743 | This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
 7744 | 
 7745 | ## Install
 7746 | 
 7747 | This package is [ESM only][esm].
 7748 | In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
 7749 | 
 7750 | ```sh
 7751 | npm install micromark-core-commonmark
 7752 | ```
 7753 | 
 7754 | In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
 7755 | 
 7756 | ```js
 7757 | import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1'
 7758 | ```
 7759 | 
 7760 | In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
 7761 | 
 7762 | ```html
 7763 | <script type="module">
 7764 |   import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1?bundle'
 7765 | </script>
 7766 | ```
 7767 | 
 7768 | ## Use
 7769 | 
 7770 | ```js
 7771 | import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark'
 7772 | 
 7773 | console.log(autolink) // Do things with `autolink`.
 7774 | ```
 7775 | 
 7776 | ## API
 7777 | 
 7778 | This module exports the following identifiers: `attention`, `autolink`,
 7779 | `blankLine`, `blockQuote`, `characterEscape`, `characterReference`,
 7780 | `codeFenced`, `codeIndented`, `codeText`, `content`, `definition`,
 7781 | `hardBreakEscape`, `headingAtx`, `htmlFlow`, `htmlText`, `labelEnd`,
 7782 | `labelStartImage`, `labelStartLink`, `lineEnding`, `list`, `setextUnderline`,
 7783 | `thematicBreak`.
 7784 | There is no default export.
 7785 | 
 7786 | Each identifier refers to a [construct][].
 7787 | 
 7788 | See the code for more on the exported constructs.
 7789 | 
 7790 | ## Types
 7791 | 
 7792 | This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
 7793 | It exports no additional types.
 7794 | 
 7795 | ## Compatibility
 7796 | 
 7797 | Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
 7798 | versions of Node.js.
 7799 | As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
 7800 | Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
 7801 | 
 7802 | This package works with `micromark` version 3+.
 7803 | 
 7804 | ## Security

 8452 | ## API
 8453 | 
 8454 | This module exports the identifier [`factorySpace`][api-factory-space].
 8455 | There is no default export.
 8456 | 
 8457 | ### `factorySpace(…)`
 8458 | 
 8459 | Parse spaces and tabs.
 8460 | 
 8461 | There is no `nok` parameter:
 8462 | 
 8463 | *   spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this factory can be

 9516 | ## Install
 9517 | 
 9518 | [npm][]:
 9519 | 
 9520 | ```sh
 9521 | npm install micromark-util-chunked
 9522 | ```
 9523 | 
 9524 | ## Use
 9525 | 
 9526 | ```js
 9527 | import {push, splice} from 'micromark-util-chunked'
 9528 | 
 9529 | // …
 9530 | 
 9531 | nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
 9532 |   ['enter', events[open][1], context],
 9533 |   ['exit', events[open][1], context]
 9534 | ])
 9535 | 
 9536 | // …
 9537 | 
 9538 | splice(events, open - 1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)
 9539 | 
 9540 | // …
 9541 | ```
 9542 | 
 9543 | ## API
 9544 | 
 9545 | This module exports the following identifiers: `push`, `splice`.
 9546 | There is no default export.
 9547 | 
 9548 | ### `push(list, items)`
 9549 | 
 9550 | Append `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).
 9551 | When `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.
 9552 | 
 9553 | This prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,
 9554 | and adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.
 9555 | 
 9556 | ###### Parameters
 9557 | 
 9558 | *   `list` (`unknown[]`) — List to operate on
 9559 | *   `items` (`unknown[]`) — Items to add to `list`
 9560 | 
 9561 | ###### Returns
 9562 | 
 9563 | `list` or `items`
 9564 | 
 9565 | ### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`
 9566 | 
 9567 | Like `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.
 9568 | 
 9569 | `Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which
 9570 | causes a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.
 9571 | 
 9572 | Otherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an
 9573 | array instead of rest parameters.
 9574 | 
 9575 | ###### Parameters
 9576 | 
 9577 | *   `list` (`unknown[]`) — List to operate on
 9578 | *   `start` (`number`) — Index to remove/insert at (can be negative)
 9579 | *   `remove` (`number`) — Number of items to remove
 9580 | *   `items` (`unknown[]`) — Items to inject into `list`
 9581 | 
 9582 | ###### Returns
 9583 | 
 9584 | `void`
 9585 |

10008 |   import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1?bundle'
10009 | </script>
10010 | ```
10011 | 
10012 | ## Use
10013 | 
10014 | ```js
10015 | import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'
10016 | 
10017 | decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
10018 | decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
10019 | decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
10020 | decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // '�' - Control
10021 | decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // '�' - Out of range
10022 | ```
10023 | 
10024 | ## API
10025 | 
10026 | This module exports the identifier:
10027 | [`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
10028 | There is no default export.
10029 | 
10030 | ### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`
10031 | 
10032 | Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
10033 | a numeric character reference into a character.
10034 | 
10035 | Sort of like `String.fromCharCode(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
10036 | non-characters and control characters safe.
10037 | 
10038 | ###### Parameters
10039 | 
10040 | *   `value` (`string`)
10041 |     — value to decode
10042 | *   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
10043 |     — numeric base
10044 | 
10045 | ###### Returns
10046 | 
10047 | Character (`string`).

10541 | ## What is this?
10542 | 
10543 | This package exposes a list of known tag names to markdown.
10544 | 
10545 | ## When should I use this?
10546 | 
10547 | This package is only useful if you want to build an alternative to micromark.
10548 | 
10549 | ## Install
10550 | 
10551 | This package is [ESM only][esm].
10552 | In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
10553 | 
10554 | ```sh
10555 | npm install micromark-util-html-tag-name
10556 | ```
10557 | 
10558 | In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
10559 | 
10560 | ```js
10561 | import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1'
10562 | ```
10563 | 
10564 | In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
10565 | 
10566 | ```html
10567 | <script type="module">
10568 |   import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle'
10569 | </script>
10570 | ```
10571 | 
10572 | ## Use
10573 | 
10574 | ```js
10575 | import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name'
10576 | 
10577 | console.log(htmlBlockNames) // ['address', 'article', …]
10578 | console.log(htmlRawNames) // ['pre', 'script', …]
10579 | ```
10580 | 
10581 | ## API
10582 | 
10583 | This module exports the identifiers [`htmlBlockNames`][api-html-block-names]
10584 | and [`htmlRawNames`][api-html-raw-names].
10585 | There is no default export.
10586 | 
10587 | ### `htmlBlockNames`
10588 | 
10589 | List of lowercase HTML “block” tag names (`Array<string>`).
10590 | 
10591 | The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
10592 | 6\).
10593 | Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly
10594 | parsed.
10595 | For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
10596 | to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.
10597 | 
10598 | This is copied from:
10599 | <https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.
10600 | 
10601 | > 👉 **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.
10602 | 
10603 | ### `htmlRawNames`
10604 | 
10605 | List of lowercase HTML “raw” tag names (`Array<string>`).
10606 | 
10607 | The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines
10608 | without exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition
10609 | 1\).
10610 | 
10611 | This module is copied from:
10612 | <https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.
10613 | 
10614 | > 👉 **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.
10615 | 
10616 | ## Types

10740 | ## What is this?
10741 | 
10742 | This package exposes an algorithm to normalize identifiers found in markdown.
10743 | 
10744 | ## When should I use this?
10745 | 
10746 | This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
10747 | 
10748 | ## Install
10749 | 
10750 | This package is [ESM only][esm].
10751 | In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
10752 | 
10753 | ```sh
10754 | npm install micromark-util-normalize-identifier
10755 | ```
10756 | 
10757 | In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
10758 | 
10759 | ```js
10760 | import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1'
10761 | ```
10762 | 
10763 | In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
10764 | 
10765 | ```html
10766 | <script type="module">
10767 |   import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1?bundle'
10768 | </script>
10769 | ```
10770 | 
10771 | ## Use
10772 | 
10773 | ```js
10774 | import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'micromark-util-normalize-identifier'
10775 | 
10776 | normalizeIdentifier(' a ') // 'A'
10777 | normalizeIdentifier('a\t\r\nb') // 'A B'
10778 | normalizeIdentifier('ТОЛПОЙ') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
10779 | normalizeIdentifier('Толпой') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
10780 | ```
10781 | 
10782 | ## API
10783 | 
10784 | This module exports the identifier
10785 | [`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].
10786 | There is no default export.
10787 | 
10788 | ### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`
10789 | 
10790 | Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).
10791 | 
10792 | Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.
10793 | 
10794 | Some characters are considered “uppercase”, such as U+03F4 (`ϴ`), but if their
10795 | lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`θ`)) is uppercased will result in a different
10796 | uppercase character (U+0398 (`Θ`)).
10797 | So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.
10798 | 
10799 | Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
10800 | prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`
10801 | is uppercase.
10802 | 
10803 | ###### Parameters
10804 | 
10805 | *   `value` (`string`)
10806 |     — identifier to normalize
10807 | 
10808 | ###### Returns
10809 | 
10810 | Normalized identifier (`string`).

10918 | micromark utility to resolve subtokens.
10919 | 
10920 | [Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
10921 | This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
10922 | italic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.
10923 | Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
10924 | and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
10925 | Because media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation
10926 | when one closing matches an opening, too.

11126 | ## What is this?
11127 | 
11128 | This package exposes an algorithm to make URLs safe.
11129 | 
11130 | ## When should I use this?
11131 | 
11132 | This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
11133 | 
11134 | ## Install
11135 | 
11136 | This package is [ESM only][esm].
11137 | In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
11138 | 
11139 | ```sh
11140 | npm install micromark-util-sanitize-uri
11141 | ```
11142 | 
11143 | In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
11144 | 
11145 | ```js
11146 | import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1'
11147 | ```
11148 | 
11149 | In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
11150 | 
11151 | ```html
11152 | <script type="module">
11153 |   import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1?bundle'
11154 | </script>
11155 | ```
11156 | 
11157 | ## Use
11158 | 
11159 | ```js
11160 | import {sanitizeUri} from 'micromark-util-sanitize-uri'
11161 | 
11162 | sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a&amp;b') // 'https://example.com/a&amp;amp;b'
11163 | sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%b') // 'https://example.com/a%25b'
11164 | sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%20b') // 'https://example.com/a%20b'
11165 | sanitizeUri('https://example.com/👍') // 'https://example.com/%F0%9F%91%8D'
11166 | sanitizeUri('https://example.com/', /^https?$/i) // 'https://example.com/'
11167 | sanitizeUri('javascript:alert(1)', /^https?$/i) // ''
11168 | sanitizeUri('./example.jpg', /^https?$/i) // './example.jpg'
11169 | sanitizeUri('#a', /^https?$/i) // '#a'
11170 | ```
11171 | 
11172 | ## API
11173 | 
11174 | This module exports the identifiers [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri] and
11175 | [`sanitizeUri`][api-sanitize-uri].
11176 | There is no default export.
11177 | 
11178 | ### `normalizeUri(value)`
11179 | 
11180 | Normalize a URL.
11181 | 
11182 | Encode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded
11183 | sequences.
11184 | 
11185 | ###### Parameters
11186 | 
11187 | *   `value` (`string`)
11188 |     — URI to normalize
11189 | 
11190 | ###### Returns
11191 | 
11192 | Normalized URI (`string`).
11193 | 
11194 | ### `sanitizeUri(url[, pattern])`
11195 | 
11196 | Make a value safe for injection as a URL.
11197 | 
11198 | This encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already
11199 | encoded sequences (see [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri]).
11200 | Further unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see
11201 | [`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).
11202 | 
11203 | A regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.
11204 | For example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or
11205 | `/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).
11206 | If the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such
11207 | as a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.
11208 | 
11209 | ###### Parameters
11210 | 
11211 | *   `url` (`string`)
11212 |     — URI to sanitize
11213 | *   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)
11214 |     — allowed protocols
11215 | 
11216 | ###### Returns
11217 | 
11218 | Sanitized URI (`string`).
11219 | 
11220 | ## Types
11221 | 
11222 | This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
11223 | It exports no additional types.
11224 | 
11225 | ## Compatibility
11226 | 
11227 | Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
11228 | versions of Node.js.
11229 | As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
11230 | Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
11231 | 
11232 | This package works with `micromark` version 3+.
11233 | 
11234 | ## Security
11235 | 
11236 | This package is safe.
11237 | See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
11238 | submit a security report.

11536 | ```sh
11537 | npm install micromark-util-symbol
11538 | ```
11539 | 
11540 | ## Use
11541 | 
11542 | ```js
11543 | import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
11544 | import {constants} from 'micromark-util-symbol/constants'
11545 | import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'
11546 | import {values} from 'micromark-util-symbol/values'
11547 | 
11548 | console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
11549 | console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
11550 | console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
11551 | console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
11552 | ```
11553 | 
11554 | ## API
11555 | 
11556 | This package has four entries in its export map: `micromark-util-symbol/codes`,
11557 | `micromark-util-symbol/constants`, `micromark-util-symbol/types`,
11558 | `micromark-util-symbol/values`.
11559 | 
11560 | Each module exports an identifier with the same name (for example,
11561 | `micromark-util-symbol/codes` has `codes`), which is an object mapping strings
11562 | to other values.

11800 | ## When should I use this?
11801 | 
11802 | <!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->
11803 | 
11804 | *   If you *just* want to turn markdown into HTML (with maybe a few extensions)
11805 | *   If you want to do *really complex things* with markdown
11806 | 
11807 | See [§ Comparison][comparison] for more info
11808 | 
11809 | ## What is this?
11810 | 
11811 | <!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->
11812 | 
11813 | `micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
11814 | It’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every
11815 | byte is accounted for, with positional info.
11816 | It then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the
11817 | data and for example build an AST which is easier to work with
11818 | ([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).
11819 | 
11820 | While most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),
11821 | this project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,
11822 | `cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.
11823 | 
11824 | Other than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to
11825 | markdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.
11826 | 
11827 | These npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:
11828 | [`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].
11829 |

11836 | ## Install
11837 | 
11838 | <!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->
11839 | 
11840 | This package is [ESM only][esm].
11841 | In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
11842 | 
11843 | ```sh
11844 | npm install micromark
11845 | ```
11846 | 
11847 | In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
11848 | 
11849 | ```js
11850 | import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'
11851 | ```
11852 | 
11853 | In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:
11854 | 
11855 | ```html
11856 | <script type="module">
11857 |   import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'
11858 | </script>
11859 | ```
11860 | 
11861 | ## Use
11862 | 
11863 | <!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->
11864 | 
11865 | Typical use (buffering):
11866 | 
11867 | ```js
11868 | import {micromark} from 'micromark'
11869 | 
11870 | console.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))
11871 | ```
11872 | 
11873 | Yields:
11874 | 
11875 | ```html
11876 | <h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>
11877 | ```
11878 | 
11879 | You can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):
11880 | 
11881 | ```js
11882 | import {micromark} from 'micromark'
11883 | import {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'
11884 | 
11885 | const value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'
11886 | 
11887 | const result = micromark(value, {
11888 |   extensions: [gfm()],
11889 |   htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]
11890 | })
11891 | 
11892 | console.log(result)
11893 | ```
11894 | 
11895 | Yields:
11896 | 
11897 | ```html
11898 | <ul>
11899 | <li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>
11900 | </ul>
11901 | ```
11902 | 
11903 | Streaming interface:
11904 | 
11905 | ```js
11906 | import {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'
11907 | import {stream} from 'micromark/stream'
11908 | 
11909 | createReadStream('example.md')
11910 |   .on('error', handleError)
11911 |   .pipe(stream())
11912 |   .pipe(process.stdout)

11914 | function handleError(error) {
11915 |   // Handle your error here!
11916 |   throw error
11917 | }
11918 | ```
11919 | 
11920 | ## API
11921 | 
11922 | `micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and
11923 | `micromark/stream`.
11924 | 
11925 | `micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].
11926 | `micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
11927 | There are no default exports.
11928 | 
11929 | The export map supports the [`development` condition][development].
11930 | Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
11931 | Without this condition, production code is loaded.
11932 | See [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.
11933 | 
11934 | ### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`
11935 | 
11936 | Compile markdown to HTML.
11937 | 
11938 | ###### Parameters
11939 | 
11940 | *   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])
11941 |     — markdown to parse
11942 | *   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)
11943 |     — [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a
11944 |     `Buffer`
11945 | *   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
11946 |     — configuration
11947 | 
11948 | ###### Returns
11949 | 
11950 | Compiled HTML (`string`).
11951 | 
11952 | ### `stream(options?)`
11953 | 
11954 | Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream.
11955 | 
11956 | Some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the
11957 | end buffering is required.
11958 | 
11959 | micromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever
11960 | streams you pipe into it.
11961 | As markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.
11962 | 
11963 | ###### Parameters
11964 | 
11965 | *   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
11966 |     — configuration
11967 | 
11968 | ###### Returns
11969 | 
11970 | Duplex stream.
11971 | 
11972 | ### `Options`
11973 | 
11974 | Configuration (TypeScript type).
11975 | 
11976 | ##### Fields
11977 | 
11978 | ###### `allowDangerousHtml`
11979 | 
11980 | Whether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).
11981 | 
11982 | The default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`
11983 | but shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.
11984 | 
11985 | Pass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.
11986 | See [§ Security][security].
11987 | 
11988 | ###### `allowDangerousProtocol`
11989 | 
11990 | Whether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:
11991 | `false`).
11992 | 
11993 | The default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous
11994 | protocols.
11995 | 
11996 | Pass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.
11997 | 
11998 | URLs that have no protocol (which means it’s relative to the current page, such
11999 | as `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,
12000 | `https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are
12001 | safe.
12002 | All other URLs are dangerous and dropped.
12003 | See [§ Security][security].
12004 | 
12005 | ###### `defaultLineEnding`
12006 | 
12007 | Default line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in
12008 | `value` (`'\r'`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\n'`).
12009 | 
12010 | Generally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) in the markdown
12011 | document over to the compiled HTML.
12012 | In some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are
12013 | added: `<blockquote>\n<p>a</p>\n</blockquote>`.
12014 | 
12015 | To create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending
12016 | that is used.
12017 | If there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.
12018 | If that isn’t configured, `\n` is used.
12019 | 
12020 | ###### `extensions`
12021 | 
12022 | Array of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default: `[]`).
12023 | See [§ Extensions][extensions].
12024 | 
12025 | ###### `htmlExtensions`
12026 | 
12027 | Array of syntax extensions (`Array<HtmlExtension>`, default: `[]`).
12028 | See [§ Extensions][extensions].
12029 |

12648 | 
12649 | This package contains the following license and notice below:
12650 | 
12651 | # MurmurHash.js
12652 | 
12653 | An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.
12654 | 
12655 | These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.
12656 | 
12657 | More information about these algorithms can be found at:
12658 | 
12659 | *	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
12660 | *	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 
12661 | 
12662 | ## Install
12663 | 
12664 |     npm install murmurhash-js
12665 |     
12666 | ## API
12667 | 
12668 | ```javascript
12669 | var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
12670 | ```
12671 | 
12672 | ### Methods
12673 | 
12674 | #### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
12675 | Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.
12676 | 
12677 | #### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
12678 | Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.
12679 | 
12680 | **Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

13110 | 
13111 | ## Acceptance
13112 | 
13113 | In order to receive this license, you must agree to its
13114 | rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations
13115 | under that agreement and conditions to your license.
13116 | You must not do anything with this software that triggers
13117 | a rule that you cannot or will not follow.
13118 | 
13119 | ## Copyright

13131 | 
13132 | ## Excuse
13133 | 
13134 | If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not
13135 | complied with [Notices](#notices), you can keep your
13136 | license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30
13137 | days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license
13138 | ends immediately.
13139 | 
13140 | ## Patent
13141 | 
13142 | Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
13143 | software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims
13144 | they can license or become able to license.
13145 | 
13146 | ## Reliability
13147 | 
13148 | No contributor can revoke this license.
13149 | 
13150 | ## No Liability
13151 | 
13152 | ***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,
13153 | without any warranty or condition, and no contributor

13317 | 
13318 | ## Acceptance
13319 | 
13320 | In order to receive this license, you must agree to its
13321 | rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations
13322 | under that agreement and conditions to your license.

13338 | 
13339 | ## Excuse
13340 |

13343 | license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30
13344 | days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license
13345 | ends immediately.
13346 | 
13347 | ## Patent

13350 | software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims
13351 | they can license or become able to license.
13352 | 
13353 | ## Reliability
13354 | 
13355 | No contributor can revoke this license.
13356 | 
13357 | ## No Liability

13360 | without any warranty or condition, and no contributor

14617 | ![Example implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasBa/recent-searches/master/RecentSearchesUX.gif)
14618 | 
14619 | ## The problem
14620 | 
14621 | Building recent searches experience can be trickier than you think (expiry of queries, ranking of recent queries, handling storage etc...)
14622 | 
14623 | ## Solution
14624 | recent-searches module helps you build that experience without having to focus on the edge cases and technical details. If available, uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store suggestions cross sessions and in the rare cases where it might not be available uses a fallback memory storage, thus loosing it's cross session functionality.
14625 | 
14626 | __The module handles:__
14627 | - Searching and retrieving recent searches
14628 | - Ranking of searches and decaying their popularity (with different ranking options)
14629 | - Saving and expiring of searches through LocalStorage or MemoryStorage
14630 | - LocalStorage feature detection (with fallback to MemoryStorage)
14631 | - Safe LocalStorage usage (feature detection, limiting storage)

16594 | 
16595 |       "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

16610 |       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
16611 |       source, and configuration files.

16617 | 
16618 |       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
16619 |       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
16620 |       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
16621 |       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
16622 | 
16623 |       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
16624 |       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
16625 |       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
16626 |       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
16627 |       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
16628 |       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
16629 |       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
16630 | 
16631 |       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
16632 |       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
16633 |       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
16634 |       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
16635 |       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
16636 |       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
16637 |       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
16638 |       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
16639 |       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
16640 |       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
16641 |       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
16642 |       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

16644 | 
16645 |       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
16646 |       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
16647 |       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
16648 | 
16649 |    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
16650 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
16651 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
16652 |       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
16653 |       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
16654 |       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
16655 | 
16656 |    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
16657 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
16658 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
16659 |       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
16660 |       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
16661 |       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
16662 |       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
16663 |       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
16664 |       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
16665 |       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
16666 |       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
16667 |       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
16668 |       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
16669 |       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
16670 |       as of the date such litigation is filed.
16671 | 
16672 |    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
16673 |       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
16674 |       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
16675 |       meet the following conditions:
16676 | 
16677 |       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
16678 |           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
16679 | 
16680 |       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
16681 |           stating that You changed the files; and
16682 | 
16683 |       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
16684 |           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
16685 |           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
16686 |           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
16687 |           the Derivative Works; and
16688 | 
16689 |       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
16690 |           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
16691 |           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
16692 |           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
16693 |           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
16694 |           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
16695 |           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
16696 |           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
16697 |           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
16698 |           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
16699 |           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
16700 |           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
16701 |           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
16702 |           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
16703 |           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
16704 |           as modifying the License.
16705 | 
16706 |       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
16707 |       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
16708 |       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
16709 |       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
16710 |       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
16711 |       the conditions stated in this License.
16712 | 
16713 |    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
16714 |       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
16715 |       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
16716 |       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
16717 |       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
16718 |       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
16719 |       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
16720 | 
16721 |    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
16722 |       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
16723 |       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
16724 |       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
16725 | 
16726 |    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
16727 |       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
16728 |       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
16729 |       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
16730 |       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
16731 |       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
16732 |       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
16733 |       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
16734 |       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
16735 | 
16736 |    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
16737 |       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
16738 |       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
16739 |       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
16740 |       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
16741 |       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
16742 |       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
16743 |       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
16744 |       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
16745 |       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
16746 |       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
16747 | 
16748 |    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
16749 |       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
16750 |       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
16751 |       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
16752 |       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
16753 |       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
16754 |       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
16755 |       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
16756 |       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
16757 |       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

16858 | 
16859 | 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

16866 | 
16867 | 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

/src/components/README.md:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | This is where most custom development work should be done.
 2 | 
 3 | Create subfolders that correspond to your features, so that components can be grouped by usage. For example, for a typical location directory you might have subfolders named `common`, `directory`, `location`.
 4 | 
 5 | Within those subfolders, components should be implemented in a file named after the component. For example a Core component would be implemented in `location/Core.tsx`. When appropriate, css should be written in a css file in the same directory as the tsx (`location/Core.css`) for example.
 6 | 
 7 | For example, a project in progress might look something like this:
 8 | 
 9 | ```
10 | components/
11 | ├── common/
12 | │   ├── Header.tsx
13 | │   └── Header.css
14 | └── location/
15 |     ├── About.tsx
16 |     ├── About.css
17 |     ├── Hero.tsx
18 |     └── Hero.css
